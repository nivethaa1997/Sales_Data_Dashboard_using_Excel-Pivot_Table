### Analysis 
<p align="justify">The data is analysed based on years and country. A pie chart is used to represent the proportion of sales in each country based on Territory and a line chart is used to represent the variation in sales over the years. In addition, for each territory a table is used to represent the numbers based on product quantity and category.</p>

<p align="justify">It is observed from the analysis that the United States of America is a major sales contributor. It makes about 94% of the sales in NA while Canada is at 6%. Over the years sales peaks after October every year as holidays are observed across the country. Though there is an occasional boost in sales in July, major proportion of the sales is done after October. After December, the sales starts declining before it gradually increases in July.</p>

**Recommendation**</br>
<p align="justify">Based on the analysis, I would recommend introducing more range during the month October and December when customers are eager to make more purchases. Additionally, A slight reduction in price or the introduction of promotional deals between January and May could help maintain customer interest and mitigate any potential decline in sales during this period.</p>
